### Texas Speedwerks, Inc. was a start-up that designed, sourced, and sold performance car parts both through retail sales and through a small distribution network. I was responsible for the research, design, building, and testing of prototype and production high-performance powertrain and suspension components for racecars and for performance-modified street cars.

- Created three separate product lines for sale.
- Grew the business to peak sales of approximately $250,000.00 per year.
- Sold the company and the product lines at a net profit for owners and investors after five years.
