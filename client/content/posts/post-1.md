#### The Dynetics Space Division designs, develops, tests, and delivers propulsion, launch, and in-space hardware to private industry as well as to NASA, DOD, and other customers. My duties include design, engineering, and project management for both propulsion and non-propulsion projects, and also participation in business development opportunities.

- Propulsion CPT Lead, Dynetics Human Landing System (DHLS) – App N
  - Led an integrated product team to design and develop the propulsion system for the DHLS lunar lander, to include main engines, RCS, PFS, and engine control systems. Also led a team, including significant design and engineering, to design, build, and test Dynetics’ first cryogenic rocket engine turbopumps.
- Project Manager, Laser Air Monitoring System (LAMS)
  - Led a team to build ECLSS support hardware for NASA Orion Spacecraft
- Propulsion IPT Lead, Dynetics Human Landing System (DHLS) – App H
  - Led an integrated product team to design and develop the propulsion system for the DHLS lunar lander, to include main engines, RCS, MPS, and engine control systems. Generated over 60 full propulsion system concepts and tested two development generations of both main engines and RCS thrusters.
- Project Manager and Propulsion Engineer, DOTC High Speed Sled
  - Designed and built a rocket-powered, cable-guided sled system to facilitate testing of countermeasure flares. The system included a 7500 pound thrust steam rocket, a full GPS and inertial guidance control system developed on program, a 4000 ft long, tower-supported cable-way, a steam generation system, and other GSE.
